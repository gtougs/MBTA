      "description": "The escalator will remain out of service for the foreseeable future. This decision was made after a thorough inspection determined that corrosion on the escalator\u2019s steel truss was so severe that it could not be repaired further and that a complete replacement of the escalator would be required. Replacing the escalator at this location requires a more extended unit meeting modern escalator safety requirements. This longer unit will require significant alteration to the station entrance to meet code requirements. The MBTA has currently begun design work to understand what station upgrades will be needed. \r\n  \r\nDue to these complexities, we expect the escalator will remain out of service for a significant time. We recognize the challenges this poses to our riders, and please know we are working to identify a solution as quickly as possible. In the meantime, Government Center Station, which is fully accessible and serves the Blue Line, is under a quarter-mile from Bowdoin Station. \r\n",

An additional five minutes will be added to the last stop of some inbound evening Franklin/Foxboro trains.\r\n\nMid-day busing between Walpole and Foxboro will continue, as will the cancellation of the mid-day Foxboro trains.\r\n\nTrain 744 (1:59PM Readville) will have a minor schedule adjustment with a three-minute later departure time and three-minute later arrival time, as a result of the changes to the Franklin/Foxboro Line.\r\n\nThe Fairmount Line schedule will be adjusted to accommodate a midday Franklin/Foxboro train (train 744) running as a local via the Fairmount Line.\r\n\nShuttle buses will continue to replace service between Foxboro and Walpole on weekdays between 9:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. to allow for construction of a permanent, accessible platform at Foxboro Station. Special event trains for concerts and Patriots games at Gillette Stadium will continue to operate during construction.",
