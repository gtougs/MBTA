      "description": "The escalator will remain out of service for the foreseeable future. This decision was made after a thorough inspection determined that corrosion on the escalator\u2019s steel truss was so severe that it could not be repaired further and that a complete replacement of the escalator would be required. Replacing the escalator at this location requires a more extended unit meeting modern escalator safety requirements. This longer unit will require significant alteration to the station entrance to meet code requirements. The MBTA has currently begun design work to understand what station upgrades will be needed. \r\n  \r\nDue to these complexities, we expect the escalator will remain out of service for a significant time. We recognize the challenges this poses to our riders, and please know we are working to identify a solution as quickly as possible. In the meantime, Government Center Station, which is fully accessible and serves the Blue Line, is under a quarter-mile from Bowdoin Station. \r\n",

      "description": "Train service will resume between Forge Park/495 station and Franklin Station, with inbound trains originating at Forge Park as previously scheduled.\r\n\nFoxboro Line trains 1765 and 1770 will now complete their trips to Foxboro Station.\r\n\nFranklin/Foxboro outbound trains will operate closer to a regular schedule with minor adjustments to allow four trains to make an additional stop at Hyde Park Station, adding approximately three minutes to the schedule and an additional five minutes to the last stop of all outbound trains.\r\n\nFranklin/Foxboro inbound trains will continue to run via the Fairmount Line and will not stop at Ruggles or Back Bay Station. An additional five minutes will be added to the last stop of some inbound evening Franklin/Foxboro trains.\r\n\nMid-day busing between Walpole and Foxboro will continue, as will the cancellation of the mid-day Foxboro trains.\r\n\nTrain 744 (1:59PM Readville) will have a minor schedule adjustment with a three-minute later departure time and three-minute later arrival time, as a result of the changes to the Franklin/Foxboro Line.\r\n\nThe Fairmount Line schedule will be adjusted to accommodate a midday Franklin/Foxboro train (train 744) running as a local via the Fairmount Line.\r\n\nShuttle buses will continue to replace service between Foxboro and Walpole on weekdays between 9:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. to allow for construction of a permanent, accessible platform at Foxboro Station. Special event trains for concerts and Patriots games at Gillette Stadium will continue to operate during construction.",
